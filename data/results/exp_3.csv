What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.
Insured Recalls Accident
	If insured recalls the accident, ask the following questions:
o	Details / description of accident.
o	Total repair damages paid to insured?
o	Total repair damages paid to other parties?
o	Did an insureds insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Did the other partys insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Was anyone injured in accident? If so, describe injuries.
	Document policy with specific information:
o	Name of person you spoke with
o	Answers to above questions
	Do NOT refer to Underwriting - information entered in comments will be reviewed when Underwriting diary generates.

What is the Quote Procedure for CSG?,"There are four areas to review for accuracy:
1.	Marital Status: If marital status is listed as Married but the spouse is not listed, verify if the spouse lives in the same household and be included as an operator.
	Add or list the spouse as a Non-Driver from the quote. In addition, the spouse's name should be listed on the PNI as an 'Additional Quote Name'.
	If the applicant is listed as single and the spouse calls:
	Verify that the customer is claiming to be the spouse of the named insured. 
	Verify that the customer's last name is the same as their listed spouse. 
	Verify that the customer is listed with their spouse on another policy through Quote Solutions (SAQ) reports. 
	If the above information can be verified, add the spouse to the policy as a named insured and an operator, per Requirements of a Sales Call > Operator Procedures. 
	If the above information cannot be verified, attempt to get the listed named insured on a 3-way call to receive permission to quote their spouse.  If the named insured can be reached, add the spouse to the policy as a named insured and an operator, per operator eligibility guidelines. 
	NOTE: In the event that the named insured cannot be reached, set a firm follow-up to speak with the named insured.
2.	Number of Operators and Vehicles: For example, three vehicles and one operator. Refer to More Vehicles than Operators.
3.	Usage: Solely to check for business use: For example, occupation is listed as plumber and the quote lists commute, probe for business use.
