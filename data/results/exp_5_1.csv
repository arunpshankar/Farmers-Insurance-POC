How do I process a cancellation from an incoming communication?,"INCOMING CORRESPONDENCES
	Process the cancellation request as long as all information listed within the Cancellation procedure has been provided, making sure the name on the request matches the named insured on the policy. 
	Effective date of cancellation (Written Correspondence) - Use requested future date (limited to 30 days in the future from postmark date if in current term / no limit for renewals that have generated but not yet taken effect), if indicated on the letter, or date after postmark (for letters).  Use day after fax or email.  For verbal requests, see the following:
o	What changes require a signed request from the named insured?  
o	How to handle an insured's request to cancel their personal auto policy
	If the insured has written the request to cancel on a 21st Century renewal bill or a 21st Century renewal declaration page (and no specific date is requested), cancel the effective date of the renewal term. 
	When in doubt, make an outbound call to confirm the date with the insured.
	Comment on every cancellation how the request was received and how the effective date was determined. 
	For written requests, send the letter, fax or a printed copy of the email to Image for potential future reference.  NOTE: Send envelopes with work for quality only if the postmark was used to determine effective date.
o	If the Policyholder is requesting to backdate the cancellation request, we will need a Declaration Page, Proof of Insurance letter (must be on company letterhead and contain information similar to Dec), ID Card(s), or Binder in order to complete the request. 
o	Documentation must show the Named Insured(s) and vehicle(s) listed on our policy as being insured on the date that corresponds to the cancellation effective date being requested. 
o	If the request is missing info (Dec Page, POI letter, ID Card, or Binder), place an outbound call to obtain. 
	If contact is made, add a diary comment with missing information and process.  The only exception to this is a missing signature.  In this case, a revised request is required. 
	If no contact is made, add a diary comment what is needed and the effective date of cancellation. 
	Example Comment: ""Received customers request to back date cancellation effective xx/xx/xxxx, all information requested was provided, imaged request.""
	Check the policy comments to see if there is another issued for this customer in the same state or another state.  If a multi-car discount has been applied to the policy that is remaining in force, (this would only apply if it is a single vehicle policy) this discount must now be deleted. 
o	The customer should receive a call to advise them of the premium change due to the deletion of the multi-car discount.

   - If any information is missing, attempt to contact the policyholder. If successful, add a diary comment with the missing information and process the request.
   - If contact is unsuccessful, add a diary comment stating the needed information and the effective date of cancellation.

    * New Hampshire Residency Form
    * SR 22

What is the process for policy retention  ?,"Retention Steps: Always try to save the policy whenever possible
Ask the customer if their policy can be reviewed for savings:
Rent vs. Own
Vehicle Discounts
Operator Assignment
Deductibles
Note: Review coverages as appropriate
Save any changes made up to this point.  Be sure to comment the retention effort and savings, if any, that were obtained.",kaD4T000000HDUEUA4,Fail,Appears to be combining data from multiple articles.; nan,Farmers HI,foobar,kaD4T000000H6NlUAK,"**Policy Retention Process**

**Objective:** Policy retention is a critical strategic objective among the Farmers Insurance Hawaii business goals. Regular policy reviews and competitor quote comparisons are important methods for retaining customers.

**Process:**

1. **Evaluate the risk** to determine whether the policy should be retained by taking the following steps:
    * Review policy
    * Review accident/loss history
    * Review payment history
    * If rates increased, determine the reason for the increase (recent accident/violation, underwriting change, etc.)
    * Verify the accuracy of information that caused the increase

2. **Do not attempt to actively retain** if any of the following criteria are met:
    * Policy has 3 or more comp/not at fault losses with us in the past 12 months
    * Policy has 2 or more return payments in the term (exclude credit card expiration date and/or company/system errors)
    * Policy has 2 or more reinstatements in the past 12 months
    * Review comments to confirm if there is an adverse/unresolved underwriting issue (i.e., open SIU, open fraudulent investigation)
    * Pursue follow-up for unresolved underwriting issues

3. **If not attempting to retain the customer**, document the reason in Comments.

4. **If the customer qualifies**, use Retention Scripting in an effort to retain the customer.

**Customer Retention Approach and Scripting**

**Insured wants to cancel the policy.**

* ""I'm sorry to hear you're requesting to cancel your policy; and I would like to keep you as part of the Farmers Hawaii family. What made you decide to cancel your policy?""

* Obtain and document the reason for cancellation or shopping.

* If rate-related, attempt an apples-to-apples comparison to a new quote/policy (see the step-by-step guide below).

**Raised the Rates/Rate Increase**

* ""Let me look into the reason for the increase. While I'm doing that, have you found a lower rate elsewhere? If so, let's do an apples-to-apples comparison to make sure that you were quoted with all of the coverages that you currently have.""

* The representative should determine if it was an across-the-board rate increase or an individual policy increase due to a rating variable change/UW reason.

**Increase due to Rate Capping**

* It is not necessary nor should the representative ever reference the rate capping process or rate cap factor to a customer. While it is a filed rating rule, it is too complex to engage in a discussion with our customers.

* ""I understand your concern over the adjustment to your renewal. There are a number of factors that can contribute to an increase in your renewal premium. Some factors include (but are not limited to) driving history, liability limits, vehicles insured, usage, and driver-to-vehicle ratios. It is our standard practice to periodically evaluate how we calculate rates. The change in your renewal premium is the result of updating our policy rating factors.""

* If the customer advises they received the same increase last renewal and asks why they are receiving another increase.

* ""We value you as our customer. As a result, we opted to apply the increase to your policy over a number of terms instead of all at once.""

* If the customer asks specifically what rating factors were changed?

* ""It's not necessarily one rating factor that changed but the way we use those factors in our rating.""

**Individual policy increase other than Rate Capping**

**Recent activity (Accident/violations)**

* ""After reviewing your policy, I found that recent activity was added to your policy, and therefore your policy renewal has increased. Shall we review your policy to make sure everything is accurate and see if there are additional savings for you?""

**Symbol change (Vehicle Rating Factor)**

* ""After reviewing your policy, I found that your vehicle rating factor has changed, and therefore your policy renewal has increased. Vehicle rating factors are determined by the Insurance Industry based upon the vehicle characteristics that may include the cost of repairs/replacement, and frequency and severity of losses. Vehicle rating factors are reevaluated on a yearly basis, which can result in a change or correction of the rating. Even though your rate was increased, we may be able to try to save you money by making a change or two to your policy. Shall we review your policy together and see if there are additional savings for you?""

**Filed Rate increase – No rate increase in place currently**

* ""We work diligently to keep our rates competitive for our customers. However, it is sometimes necessary that we adjust our rates when the amount of losses and settlement costs are higher than we anticipated, or to comply with state regulations. By continuously reassessing and modifying our rates, we are able to maintain a level of quality service for our customers. Even though your rate was increased, we may be able to save you money by making a change or two to your policy. Shall we review your policy together and see if there are additional savings for you?""

**Found A Better Deal / Saved Money Somewhere Else**

* ""Auto insurance is a complicated product. Let's make sure the quoted rated includes all of the coverages that are part of your current policy. We may be able to save you even more money by making a change or two to your policy. Shall we review your policy together and see if there are additional savings for you?""

**Customer Response to Scripting:**

**Yes:**

* Request to review their new quote together for an apples-to-apples comparison between this policy and the competitor's quote/policy.
* Review policy deductibles, payment plan, discounts, etc.
* Check for recent activity on this policy and compare it to the new quote/policy.
* Important: Make sure to obtain customer approval and necessary forms if applicable prior to saving any changes.
* Point out discounts already included in the current policy rate if applicable
    * Multi-Car Discount

    * Claims Fee Discount 20%

    * Anti-Theft Discount 5% (Comp Only)
    * Anti-Lock Brakes 3%

* Remind the customer of our complimentary coverages/benefits that are included in the policy at no extra cost:
    * Extended Transportation $1000 customization coverage included if Comp/Coll on policy
    * Hawaiian Airlines 5% Discount on flights in North America

    * Towing and Labor (Including Concierge Services)
    * Extended Transportation Expenses
    * Wage Loss Coverage
    * Death Coverage
    * Funeral Coverage
    * Alternative Care Coverage
* If the customer accepts the revised policy and/or chooses to renew their policy.

* ""I am glad that I was able to help. In the next few days, you will receive revised policy material in the mail confirming the change we just made.""

* If payment is needed, continue with payment scripting.

**No:**

**Cancellation date is in the future over 30 days:**

* ""Please send your request to cancel in writing to ""servicing office"" address. It has been our pleasure to serve you in the past and we wish you well in the future. Have a good (day or night).""

**Cancellation date is in the next 30 days or 14 days in the past:**

* Process the cancellation in PSP (no proof is required).

**Cancellation date is over 14 days in the past (up to 30 days in the past):**

* ""Please send in a declaration page with a letter, in writing, stating the date you would like to cancel. It has been our pleasure to serve you in the past and we wish you well in the future. Have a good (day or night)."""

What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.

This process should only be followed if the check has not been received after 30 days from the date it was issued, and the check was issued with the correct information (including mailing address). 

Here are some reasons why you may want to put a stop payment on a disbursement check:

- The check was issued to the wrong address.
- The check was lost or destroyed.
- The check is to be reapplied to another policy that has been reinstated and not yet paid in full, or is inactive/cancelled with an outstanding earned premium, or is active and all insureds match.
- The check is to be reapplied to the same policy only if it has been reinstated or has had a premium increasing endorsement.
- The check is to be sent back to the lender as payment was inconclusive to the customer and lender contract.
- The check is more than 180 days old and there is no AR letter on file.
- The bank has already rejected the check due to the issuance date.
- The check was issued to the wrong named insured(s) due to the death of the named insured(s) or due to the wrong named insured(s) being on the original policy.

1. **Determine the property's sinkhole score and area score using the Sinkhole Coverage Eligibility Matrix.**
   - If the scores fall under the 'Clear' category, you can bind sinkhole coverage with the policy.
   - If the scores fall under the 'Inspection' category, a physical inspection of the property is required.
   - If the scores fall under the 'Ineligible' category, sinkhole coverage is unavailable.

2. **For 'Clear' cases:**
   - At new business, include the necessary request forms in the customer's application and have them signed/initialed.
   - For change transactions, submit a signed Sinkhole Coverage Request form.

3. **For 'Inspection' cases:**
   - Obtain a sinkhole property inspection completed within the past 45 days by a professional geologist or engineer.
   - Submit the signed Sinkhole Coverage Request form and the inspection report via PolicyCenter with the Underwriting Issue exception process.

- The inspection is paid for by the client, not by Farmers.
- If the inspection is unavailable at new business, the coverage can be removed to bind the policy. Once the inspection is obtained, add the coverage to the policy and submit the documentation through the Underwriting Issue process."

How do I fix the issue where the Agent cannot enter a payment through their ACA?,"Resolution
	First, attempt to use the agent's district manager's agent code.

o	Example: Agent = 45-32-31                 District Manager = 45-32-01
	For Inactive agents, Express should replace the agent code with one of the generic ACA codes below.
	If this has not happened, and the Inactive agents ACA still shows on the billing side of express, please refer for defect 724086. 
	If this does not correct the issue, use one of the ACA codes below and notate the billing account on what code was used for payment:

- Registering a car with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV): The Certificate of Title Surety can be presented to the DMV in lieu of a traditional vehicle title to complete the registration process for a motor vehicle.

- Obtaining insurance coverage: Some insurance companies may accept a Certificate of Title Surety as proof of ownership when purchasing insurance for a vehicle. It's advisable to check with your preferred insurance provider to confirm their specific requirements.

- Selling a car: When selling a vehicle, a Certificate of Title Surety can be used as a valid form of ownership documentation, allowing the seller to transfer ownership of the vehicle to the buyer.

What are the underwriting concerns when adding a vehicle to a policy?,"All underwriting scenarios require the representative to probe, document and please submit an FH AUT request in forms
 
Review the scenarios and additional details below: 
More Vehicles than Operators: 
Probe for undisclosed operators and reason for the amount vehicles they own.  
Frequency of Policy Changes (add/replace/delete vehicles): 
Probe if the insured may be buying and selling vehicles or if an unusual circumstance exists that are not addressed in the underwriting guidelines, do not add vehicle
Listed Vehicle(s) that are NOT titled, registered, or leased to the Named Insured, Spouse or Listed Operator on the policy:  
Probe to determine how vehicle is registered, the usage of the vehicle, and where it is garaged
Do not add titled owner / registrant as a named insured to provide coverage",kaD4T000000XiuDUAS,Pass,Creative Answer; Vehicles garaged in high-crime areas or areas with adverse weather conditions may be considered higher risk.,Farmers HI,foobar,kaD4T000000PKvqUAG,"Sure, here's a detailed and comprehensive answer based on the provided context:

**Underwriting Concerns when Adding a Vehicle to a Policy:**

1. **Number of Vehicles or Operators:**
   - When a policy has more than 6 vehicles or operators, the risk must be assessed for acceptability before adding the new vehicle.

2. **Frequency of Vehicle Changes:**
   - Review the transaction history to verify the frequency of vehicle changes.
   - Probe to determine if the customer buys/sells vehicles frequently or has a side business (e.g., taxi).
   - Ensure there are no commercial exposures and that the named insured has an insurable interest.
   - All vehicles listed must be garaged at the resident address (exceptions may apply as per Farmers Hawaii Underwriting Guidelines: Section 2 - Split Household).

3. **Probing Questions:**
   - How many drivers are in the household?
   - Who operates the vehicles listed?
   - How are the vehicles used?
   - How are the vehicles titled/registered?
   - Are all your vehicles principally garaged at your residence?

4. **Unacceptable Risk:**
   - If the risk is deemed unacceptable, do not add the vehicle or operator to the policy.
   - Send a referral to Underwriting for further evaluation.

5. **Eligible Risk:**
   - If the risk is eligible, follow the appropriate process for adding a vehicle or operator.

**Additional Details:**

- **More Than 6 Vehicles:**
  - Newly purchased vehicles are generally added to the policy on the date of purchase.
  - For policies issued by OMNI, new policies are issued the next day at 12:01 AM.
  - To add a vehicle as of the date of purchase:
    - Transfer the customer to the Rewrite Team (#8809) to create a new policy for the new vehicle.
    - If the Rewrite Team is unavailable, warm transfer the call to Sales.

- **Procedures for Creating a New Policy:**
  - A new policy will be issued for the new vehicle.
  - Another vehicle from the first policy must be included to apply the multi-car discount and offer stacked UM/UIM coverages.
  - Have the customer select the additional vehicle to be listed on the second policy.
  - Note: The split policy indicator does not currently work for Hawaii policies.
  - BI, PD, PIP, and UM/UIM coverages should be the same on both policies.
  - UM/UIM coverages require a new form to reduce or reject the coverage.
  - Once the new policy is issued, send a back-office referral to change the effective date of the new vehicle to the date of purchase.
  - Always list the Named Insured and Spouse as Operators, as well as anyone else who would be operating the additional vehicles.
  - Use the SDS to send a CVL.
  - Send a Clerical Referral to issue an ID Card. Comment the policy.

- **More Than 6 Operators:**
  - If a policy has more than 6 operators, the following operators shall be rated on the existing policy:
    - Named Insured and Spouse
    - Anyone with driving activity
    - Youngest Operators
  - Any other operators will be listed as ""OI"" - Other Insurance.
  - Representatives will be expected to obtain the following information for each operator:
    - Name of Operator
    - Relationship
    - Date of Birth
    - Driver's License Information
  - After all operators have been reclassified:
    - Advise that a Motor Vehicle Report (MVR) will be ordered, and the price is subject to change.
    - Send an Underwriting Referral.
    - Comment the policy.

- **Additional Policy for an Operator:**
  - An additional policy for an operator should only be created if there are more than 6 vehicles and the additional operator will be operating one of the listed vehicles.

- **Rewrite / Sales Team Procedures:**
  - After following the above process, create a new quote using the same Customer Contact Information as Named Insured/Spouse.
  - Use the Key Code as REISSU and select the same account number listed on the original policy.
  - Select the Multi-State/Car field indicator.
  - Current Carrier field: List as Currently Insured - Farmers Hawaii. Enter the expiration date as of their current policy.
  - Prior BI Limits: Update the BI limits to reflect their current BI coverage.
  - Effective date of the policy should be the next day or when the vehicle was removed from the policy (whichever is later).
  - DO NOT list any driving activity.
  - The named insured and spouse should be listed as operators. In addition, any other operators intending to operate the vehicle(s) listed.
  - UM/UIM Coverages should be ""Stacked."" To Stack UM/UIM coverages, another vehicle must be moved over to the additional policy. Allow the customer to select a vehicle. Note: Remember to add the primary operator who would operate the additional vehicle.
  - Advise the customer of the amount of the quote.
  - Collect a down payment for the new policy.
    - Note: Remind the customer of the required forms and promote e-Signature.
  - Advise the customer of the paperwork to be received (e.g., Application, UM/UIM form, new business packet, declarations page, insurance card, billing, etc.).
  - The customer will need to make a new down payment for their extra policy.
  - Set a Suspense Comment to follow up in approximately 2 days to ensure the quote was enrolled and ID cards were mailed.
  - Add a Suspense Comment for both policies.
  - Send a referral to Premium Accounting - PSP - Change in Effective Date to have the new policies' effective date changed to the date of purchase of the vehicle.

**Exception: DNR Set for the Original Policy**

- If the original policy is set to non-renew, create the multiple policies as stated above.
- Issue a non-renewal notice on the newly created policy.
- If there is insufficient time to issue the notice by the original DNR date, the DNR will be set for the next term.
- Note: Generally, DNR notices are generated 35 days prior to the expiration date."

Why Is the registered owner of my vehicle not someone in my household?,"ID cards reflect that the registered owner for a vehicle is someone who is not listed in the household. At times this may be done because the Registered Owner is someone other then the vehicle owner.

If vehicle is leased it should show the owner as the leasing company or if the registered owner is listed as a RO type of additional insured they will show as the Registered owner on ID cards.

The person listed on the ID cards could have been pulled in from SIMS.

If necessary please contact Personal Lines for further assistance to determine if registered owner is showing correctly. ",kaD4T0000009MBnUAM,Pass,nan; nan,Farmers,foobar,kaD4T0000009MBnUAM,"Sure, here's a detailed and comprehensive answer based on the provided context:

**Why is the registered owner of your vehicle not someone in your household?**

According to the context, there are a few reasons why the registered owner of your vehicle may not be someone in your household:

1. **Leased Vehicle:** If your vehicle is leased, the leasing company may be listed as the registered owner.

2. **Registered Owner as Additional Insured:** If the registered owner is listed as a ""RO"" type of additional insured, they will show as the registered owner on the ID cards.

3. **Data Pulled from SIMS:** In some cases, the person listed on the ID cards may have been pulled in from SIMS (State Insurance Management System).

**Steps to Update the Registered Owner:**

If the registered owner listed on your ID cards is incorrect, you can follow these steps to update it:

1. Access your policy in Express.

2. Go to the ""Vehicle"" tab.

3. Select the vehicle with the incorrect registered owner.

4. In the ""Registered Owner"" drop-down, deselect the person currently listed, even if it is showing the correct registered owner.

5. Select the correct registered owner from the drop-down list.

6. Click ""Update"" and continue.

7. Rate and submit the policy.

8. Access your policy in Express again and pull up your ID cards to verify that the registered owner has been updated.

**Additional Information:**

- If the issue persists after following these steps, contact the Help Desk or ASC for further assistance.

- To view the vehicle owner in Green Screens:
  - Open the policy in Green Screens.
  - Go to the CV screen.
  - Go to the IA screen.
  - Check if the ""Vehicle Owner"" type is listed as ""LS"" (Leased) or ""RO"" (Registered Owner).

- If there is a lien holder on the vehicle, check the lien holder type. It should match what is shown on the IA screen:
  - LN - Lienholder (shows the person listed as ""RO"" on the ID card)
  - LR - Lessor (shows the leasing company on the ID card)
  - RO - Registered Owner (other than leasing company, shows as the registered owner on the ID card)

If the registered owner is not rated on the policy, they will be listed as the registered owner on the ID card."

What is the Quote Procedure for CSG?,"There are four areas to review for accuracy:
1.	Marital Status: If marital status is listed as Married but the spouse is not listed, verify if the spouse lives in the same household and be included as an operator.
	Add or list the spouse as a Non-Driver from the quote. In addition, the spouse's name should be listed on the PNI as an 'Additional Quote Name'.
	If the applicant is listed as single and the spouse calls:
	Verify that the customer is claiming to be the spouse of the named insured. 
	Verify that the customer's last name is the same as their listed spouse. 
	Verify that the customer is listed with their spouse on another policy through Quote Solutions (SAQ) reports. 
	If the above information can be verified, add the spouse to the policy as a named insured and an operator, per Requirements of a Sales Call > Operator Procedures. 
	If the above information cannot be verified, attempt to get the listed named insured on a 3-way call to receive permission to quote their spouse.  If the named insured can be reached, add the spouse to the policy as a named insured and an operator, per operator eligibility guidelines. 
	NOTE: In the event that the named insured cannot be reached, set a firm follow-up to speak with the named insured.
2.	Number of Operators and Vehicles: For example, three vehicles and one operator. Refer to More Vehicles than Operators.
3.	Usage: Solely to check for business use: For example, occupation is listed as plumber and the quote lists commute, probe for business use.

How do I get a copy of the EFT authorazation form after it is set up?,"If the agent has set up autopay and needs to obtain a copy of the authorization form, it can be located under the billing documents tab in Direct bill when there is a pending authorization for a paper EFT authorization form
Once the trigger to receive the form is available this document will no longer be available",kaD4T000000XnteUAC,Partial Pass,"Duplicate  Information; Same info twice. Also switched the words, it is not Direct Bill Tab, it is under billing documents tab.",Commercial,foobar,kaD4T000000XnteUAC,"**How to Obtain a Copy of the EFT Authorization Form After Autopay is Set Up**

**Paper Form**

- If an agent sets up automatic payments and chooses a paper form as the authorization type, the form is available to save or print from PaymentsHub.
- The user cannot proceed with submitting autopay until the PDF authorization form is opened.
- If the agent has set up autopay and needs to obtain a copy of the authorization form, it can be located under the billing documents tab in Direct Bill when there is a pending authorization for a paper EFT authorization form.
- Once the trigger to receive the form is available, this document will no longer be available.

**DocuSign**

- If the DocuSign invitation needs to be resent using the same email address and cell phone number that was entered previously:
 - The agent will need to contact the service center to request the DocuSign invitation be resent.

- If the DocuSign invitation needs to be resent using a new cell phone or email address:
 - The agent can update the customer contact information in PaymentsHub.
 - This will result in a new DocuSign invitation being sent to the customer.

**Please note:** If the authorization type chosen during autopay set up was an electronic signature (DocuSign), the paper form will not be available in Direct Bill.

**Requests to Resend DocuSign**

- If the authorization type is an electronic signature and the agent asks for the DocuSign invitation to be resent, the representative should follow these steps:
 - Verify the date the recurring payment process was initiated as the DocuSign Envelope expires after 40 days and will require a new APR to be initiated.
 - *Note: It can take up to 5 days from envelope expiration to removal in PaymentsHub.*
 - If over 40 days, direct the agent to PaymentsHub to remove APR if it has not yet been removed by the system.
 - If under 40 days, confirm the phone number and email address the agent used when setting up the APR are correct (the phone number should be a cell).
 - If the information is correct, please notate the Service Request confirming the email address and phone number. Refer to the Resolution Team by opening up the Edit option in the Service Request and change the owner to the BIG Billing Non-Phone Team Lead. The Resolution Team will resend the DocuSign invitation.
 - If under 40 days and the agent advises the phone number and/or email are not correct:
  - Have the agent edit the auto-pay rule, enter the correct email address and/or phone number.
  - Once the changes are submitted, a new authorization form will be sent to the new email using the new phone number automatically."

Generally, State facilities do not accept electronic ID Cards when requesting proof of insurance. ID Cards must print on state approved fraud resistant paper. Faxed or Emailed ID Cards are not valid proof of insurance.

As a courtesy, the company may fax or mail ID cards per the customer's request. There are specific letters designed to accommodate the State's requirements: 
Refer to: Customer Service Manual Letters
NOTE: PRIOR TO SENDING CUSTOMERS EMAILS CONTAINING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, REVIEW THE EMAIL PROCESS WITHIN ARTICLE: Does an email sent through SRM need to be encrypted?",kaD4T000000Xls5UAC,Fail,Wrong Summarization within Article; First section is corect but incomplete. Second section is not from the article.,Farmers HI,foobar,kaD4T000000Xls5UAC,"In Hawaii, state facilities generally do not accept electronic ID cards as proof of insurance. ID cards must be printed on state-approved fraud-resistant paper. Faxed or emailed ID cards are not considered valid proof of insurance. However, the company may fax or mail ID cards upon customer request as a courtesy. Specific letters are designed to meet the state's requirements, which can be found in the Customer Service Manual Letters.

It's important to note that ID cards are not sufficient proof for additional insureds (AIs) or loss payees (LPs). For AIs or LPs, you can access the Loss Payee notice for the applicable vehicle in EDMR and attach it to the SR. You can then email or fax the notice through SRM. If mailing is necessary, follow the instructions provided in the ""How to Mail Documents"" article.

For CVL policies, use the auto corr function and select the CSCVL. Choose the appropriate vehicles to submit proof to the LP/AI. Proof can be sent via fax, email, or mail. The AI/LP can also call to verbally verify coverage.

In cases where there are multiple named insureds, both will appear on the ID cards. The spouse needs to be listed on the Policy Interest screen. If the last name has a space in it, the system may not transpose the name correctly. In such cases, you can transpose the name when listing the spouse's name in the Policy Interest field.

For ID card requests, system-generated ID cards will be printed with the named insured(s) and address listed on the Basic Contract Detail screen. They will be mailed to the same address. If a different name is requested on the ID card or if it should be mailed to a different address, a manual ID card request should be processed.

Before requesting or issuing additional ID cards, it's advisable to review the Amendment History and Comments screen. If a Premium Bearing Endorsement has been processed within the last 7-10 days, determine if the customer has received the packet in the mail before issuing another set of cards.

For premium-bearing endorsements, ID cards will be automatically mailed to the customer. Non-premium-bearing endorsements or other cases where no endorsement is needed can be processed through PSP by choosing Documents -> Proof of Ins/ID Cards and selecting the appropriate option (Mail or E-mail).

If a Renewal Mod has been generated, repeat the above process on the Renewal Mod and communicate the proper timeframe to the customer. System-issued ID cards will be received within 7-10 days.

Customers can also request an ID card to be issued for pickup at the local office. However, it's important to verify that the office location is open for walk-in pickups. Requests for pickup ID cards should be referred to the Farmers HI-Word Processing queue, and details such as policy number, insured name, and vehicle information should be included. The request should be completed within 1 hour.

ID cards are required to be issued in the name of the vehicle's owner. It's not necessary for additional operators to be listed on ID cards. However, if an insured requests an ID card issued in the name of an operator who is not a named insured (such as a child), certain conditions apply. You should ask how the vehicle is registered. If the vehicle is co-registered or registered only to the non-named insured, an individual ID card is acceptable. These ID cards are manually created, and all information must be documented in PSP. If the vehicle is registered only to the named insured, an individual ID card will not be issued.

For manual ID card requests, you can complete the FH ID Card Order Request form and select ""Standard"" under Card Type. Include any additional details in the additional comments section. Document the ID Card Request Number in Diary Comments. Verify the mailing address and/or email address, and include any additional details. The ID cards requested must reflect the current effective dates of the policy period.

For overnight requests, they must be requested before specific times (provided in the context) to be processed the same day. Overnight requests require supervisor approval and are not available on weekends. When daylight savings ends, the times mentioned should be adjusted accordingly. FedEx tracking numbers will be documented in the Comments of the Policy. Farmers Hawaii will pay for overnight delivery of ID cards, but this option should not be advertised and is only available in emergency or company error situations. Other options like email or the app should be offered before requesting overnight delivery.

For Canadian ID card requests, you can complete the FH ID Card Order Request form and select the option for Canadian under Card Type. Proof of insurance may be faxed, but overnight requests are not available due to contract limitations. PSO can email Canadian ID cards.

The IVR Automated Response ID Cards section provides information about the messages customers will hear when accessing the ID Card IVR System. Customers can authenticate themselves by providing a combination of policy number, phone number, or zip code. They can then choose to have the ID cards mailed or faxed. If mailed, the customer will be informed that the ID cards will be sent to the address on the policy and should be received within 7-10 days. If faxed, the customer will be asked to provide their 10-digit fax number, which will be confirmed before the request is processed. The customer will be informed that the ID cards will be faxed to the provided number and should be received shortly. If email is requested, the customer will be informed that the ID cards will be sent to the email address on the policy and should be received within one hour. A comment will be added to the system indicating that an ID card was requested and sent."
Can I offer an extension on an account with a DNOC?,The article doesn't excplicity say it offers extension. Expecting answer not found reply.,kaD4T000000Xl3xUAC,Partial Pass,nan; nan,Commercial,foobar,kaD4T000000Xl3xUAC,"Based on the provided context, extensions are generally not granted for accounts with a Direct Notice of Cancellation (DNOC). However, exceptions may be considered under certain circumstances. Here are the factors that will be taken into account when evaluating a request for an extension:

1. Previous Payment History in the Last 12 Months:
   - Assess the account's payment history over the past year. Consistent and timely payments may increase the chances of an extension being granted.

2. Expected Payment Date for the Outstanding Balance:
   - Determine when the payment for the balance due is expected. If a specific and reasonable payment date is provided, it may support the case for an extension.

3. Previous Cancellations on the Account:
   - Check if there have been any previous cancellations on the account. Multiple cancellations within a short timeframe may reduce the likelihood of an extension being approved.

4. Recent Extensions within the Last 12 Months:
   - Verify if an extension has been granted within the past 12 months. If there have been frequent requests for extensions, it may affect the decision.

5. Extenuating Circumstances:
   - Consider any extenuating circumstances that may have impacted the account holder's ability to make timely payments. Examples include hospitalization, fraud, missing payments, or agency/bank errors.

6. Invalid Mailing Address or Returned Mail:
   - If the DNOC or other important notices were not received due to an invalid mailing address or returned mail, this may be considered a valid reason for an extension.

7. Extraordinary Events:
   - Check if the account holder's region is experiencing any extraordinary events, such as natural disasters or catastrophes. In such cases, extensions may be granted as per the guidelines outlined in the Multiple States Extraordinary Events Landing Page.

It's important to note that certain reasons, such as the insured being on vacation or out of the country, are not considered valid grounds for an extension. If an extension is approved, the following steps will be taken:

1. Rescind the Pending Cancellation (if applicable):
   - If the account was previously marked for cancellation, the pending cancellation will be rescinded.

2. Place a Stop Dunn:
   - A Stop Dunn will be placed for an appropriate duration to prevent further billing actions.

3. Notate SRM and Billing:
   - Detailed notes will be made in the System for Reference Management (SRM) and Billing systems, specifying the approval and reason for the extension.

4. Close the Service Request:
   - The service request related to the extension request will be closed once the necessary actions are completed.

Remember, these guidelines are subject to the discretion of the insurance provider, and individual cases may be handled differently based on specific circumstances."

The company has identified the impacted policies and is sending emails to the affected insureds to inform them about the incorrect information. They are actively working to correct the error and will be sending revised policy documents shortly, reflecting the correct premium amount.

In the meantime, if you receive a call from a customer regarding an increase in their premium and their policy has the BC #HI-56 comment, you should apologize for the inconvenience and reassure them that the revised documents will be received soon.

Here's an example of the email being sent to the affected insureds:

Insured wants to dispute a loss with Farmers Hawaii,"Disputed Activity  Loss With Farmers Hawaii

When an Insured attempts to obtain insurance with another company it is likely that that company will order a CLUE report through Lexis Nexis that will show claim activity reported by Farmers Hawaii.

If the insured disagrees with what is being reported by Farmers Hawaii, they may contact Farmers Hawaii to correct reported activity.
Customer Service Consultants - if a call disputing CLUE is received, transfer the call to the Claims Department for appropriate handling.
	See How to Locate Phone Numbers for Other Departments for Claims Transfer Procedures
After review, if the Adjuster / Manager agrees with the Insured that the CLUE report is incorrect, a CLUE correction will need to be submitted to Lexis Nexis.

If the Insured discusses the situation with the Adjuster / Manager and does not agree with the decision, the Insured may call Lexis Nexis and file a dispute themselves. If this happens, a CLUE dispute will be received from Lexis Nexis and the claim will need to be investigated to determine if the dispute being presented by the Insured is correct or not. A response (via fax) to Lexis Nexis is needed to advise them if the dispute is valid or not. Discuss the issue with the adjuster who handled their claim.

Here are the key details regarding the acceptability of a Social Security disability check stub as proof of residency for OOH drivers:

- The check stub must be current, meaning it should be submitted within 30 days of the statement date or the period covered by the statement or paycheck stub date.

- The address on the check stub must be different from the insured's policy address and must be a valid, physical address (not a PO Box).

- The name of the driver being requested to be placed out of household must be clearly listed on the check stub and match what is listed on the Farmers policy.

- The check stub should show the driver's name and the address that needs to be designated as Out of Household.

It's important to note that if the residence address for the Auto policy is the same as the address on the Social Security disability check stub, the driver cannot be placed Out of Household and will need to be excluded on request when permissible.

When placing an extension is PA an auto long state?,No - or not found in article.,kaD4T0000004dpNUAQ,Pass,nan; nan,Farmers Specialty Auto,foobar,kaD4T0000008VapUAE,"**Extension Details for Pennsylvania (PA)**

- **Auto Long State:** Yes, Pennsylvania (PA) is considered an auto long state.

**Extension Guidelines for Long States:**

- Extensions cannot be placed past the next scheduled diary date, which falls 9 to 11 days after the due date (depending on the month's length).
- If an extension date exceeds the allowed limit, the transaction will be blocked, and an error message will be displayed.

**Extension Limits for Long States:**

- Monthly Accounts:
  - Controls: Default to 30 days but only guarantee the next statement will print, regardless of the date.
  - Extensions:
    - Placed for 10 days
    - **California (CA) ONLY:** Maximum extension is 7 days.
      - CA requires a 3-day extension of the NOC due date beyond the regular due date, so a maximum 10-day extension only grants an additional 7 days from the NOC date.

**Additional Information:**

- For Single Policy Accounts (1, 2, or 4 Pay):
  - Controls default to 30 days but only guarantee that the next statement will print, regardless of the date.
  - Extensions placed for 30 days.

- Diary date: The date the next statement needs to issue.
  - CA and Long NOC states require a shorter extension or might not be able to receive one at all.
  - CA requires 23 days from NOC issued on a monthly account instead of 20, so the maximum extension is 7 days instead of 10.
  - If an extension is placed beyond the diary date, the policy may cancel, or coverage may remain active, but the next statement will not generate.

According to the Delaware Workers' Compensation (WC) Merit Rating Plan, a 5% (5.0%) discount is applied for risks with no compensable employee lost-time injuries. This means that if a business has no lost-time claims, they will receive a discount on their workers' compensation insurance premium.

**Key Points:**

- The claims considered for the discount are listed in the experience tabulation under Section V, Paragraph 4 of the Merit Rating Plan.
- The discount is calculated based on the number of compensable employee lost-time injuries:
  - No compensable employee lost-time injuries: 5% (5.0%) discount
  - One (1) compensable employee lost-time injury: no discount or surcharge
  - Two (2) or more compensable employee lost-time injuries: 5 percent (5.0%) surcharge

**Additional Information:**

- The Merit Rating Plan Adjustments are determined by the Delaware Compensation Rating Bureau (DCRB) and communicated to the insurance carrier.
- The purpose of the Merit Rating Plan is to reward businesses with good safety records and encourage them to maintain safe working conditions."

1. **Fraud-Resistant Paper**: ID cards must be printed on state-approved fraud-resistant paper. This paper has a red strip along the right side of the page.

2. **No Faxed or Emailed ID Cards**: Faxed or emailed ID cards are not considered valid proof of insurance in Hawaii.

4. **Electronic ID Cards**: Generally, state facilities do not accept electronic ID cards as proof of insurance.

5. **Company Codes**: Hawaii does not require the inclusion of company codes on ID cards.

6. **Paperless Customers**: Even if a customer has opted for paperless communication, ID cards are still mailed to the customer's address.

7. **Effective Dates**: ID cards, whether system-generated or manual, reflect the dates of the policy term.

8. **Spouse Inclusion**: Both named insureds appear on ID cards. If the spouse needs to be added, they must be listed on the Policy Interest screen.

9. **Operators on ID Cards**: ID cards are required to be issued in the name of the vehicle's owner. Additional operators do not need to be listed on the ID cards.

10. **Manual ID Card Requests**: For specific cases where a manual ID card is required, Farmers Hawaii provides a form called the ""FH ID Card Order Request."" This form should be completed and submitted for manual ID card requests.

6. **Waiting Period for Refunds:** Bank account refunds can only be processed if at least 5 business days have passed since the payment, and there have been no returns.

7. **Dispute Resolution:** Verify if the insured has filed a dispute with their bank. If a dispute has been filed, the insured must allow the dispute process to refund the money.

8. **Notification of Potential Debt:** Advise the insured that any return or dispute of the payment will result in the insured owing the refund back to the company.

**Additional Information:**

- **PaymentsHub Guide:** Refer to the PaymentsHub guide for instructions on how to refund a bank account payment.

	Are you sure? Click OK to continue. (W00008)"" when attempting to enter the agent of record's ACA.
Resolution
	First, attempt to use the agent's district manager's agent code.
	The district manager's agent code will be the same besides the last two digits, which will be 01.
o	Example: Agent = 45-32-31                 District Manager = 45-32-01
	For Inactive agents, Express should replace the agent code with one of the generic ACA codes below.
	If this has not happened, and the Inactive agents ACA still shows on the billing side of express, please refer for defect 724086. 
	If this does not correct the issue, use one of the ACA codes below and notate the billing account on what code was used for payment:

1. **Agent Identification Number Not on File**: The agent's identification number is not registered or associated with an established ACA. This can occur if the agent is newly appointed or licensed in multiple states but only has one established ACA.

2. **Inactive Agent of Record**: If the agent of record is inactive, they will not be able to process payments through their ACA.

3. **New Agent without Established ACA**: It can take up to 20 days for a new agent's ACA to be set up and activated. During this period, the agent cannot process payments through their ACA.

**Workaround**:

If the agent encounters the ""agent identification number not on file"" error message, they can use the following workaround:

1. **Use District Office Code**: If the agent has an active District Office, they can use the State, Region, and ""01"" code instead of their ACA code.

   - Example: Agent Code = 45-32-31 / District Manager Code = 45-32-01

2. **Eastern Zone Code**: For agents in the Eastern Zone, use the code ""04-99-75"".

3. **Western Zone Code**: For agents in the Western Zone, use the code ""29-99-75"".

**Note**: It is important to document which ACA code is used in the billing comment to ensure the payment can be located if necessary.

If the issue persists or the agent requires further assistance, they should contact Service Operations Direct Services at 1-888-327-6335."

- If the agent has set up autopay and needs to obtain a copy of the authorization form, it can be located under the billing documents tab in Direct Bill when there is a pending authorization for a paper EFT authorization form.
- Once the trigger to receive the form is available, this document will no longer be available.

**DocuSign**

- If the DocuSign invitation needs to be resent using the same email address and cell phone number that was entered previously:

- If the DocuSign invitation needs to be resent using a new cell phone or email address:

 - If the information is correct, please notate the Service Request confirming the email address and phone number. Refer to the Resolution Team by opening up the Edit option in the Service Request and change the owner to the BIG Billing Non-Phone Team Lead. The Resolution Team will resend the DocuSign invitation.

Refer to the article ""Agency Services: How does Agent & Policy Transition (APT) request missing information on an agent transfer request?"" for more details.

**Expediting an AOR Change Request:**

Expediting an AOR change request is only used to initiate the transfer process. If the transfer is processed through the OPRA system, it involves a 3-step process and cannot be expedited once started. The OPRA system must complete each step sequentially. Some policies may take longer to process than others. Typically, the transfer is completed within 5-10 business days from the start of the process.

In some cases, a reorder may be necessary, which will add additional business days to the completion time. The SR comments will indicate if a reorder was processed. The vast majority of AOR transfers are completed within 5 business days once the Agent & Policy Transition (APT) team starts the transfer process.

CSG Representatives are extremely timely; this outbound call can be placed as soon as the customer completes the quote online as we strive to be the prospect's first contact.  However, in many instances, the prospect has not received the rate.",kaD4T000000H6tmUAC,Partial Pass,Incomplete Answer; nan,Farmers HI,foobar,kaD4T000000H6tmUAC,"CSG stands for Customer Solutions Group. It is an outbound lead generation program where prospects who visit the Farmers Hawaii website or an aggregator site may receive a call from a CSG representative. The CSG representative's role is to transfer the prospect to a Farmers Hawaii representative to discuss auto insurance quotes.

CSG representatives make timely calls, often reaching out as soon as the customer completes the online quote. However, in some cases, the prospect may not have received the quote yet.

CSG leads account for approximately 40% of the call volume. While these leads may be more challenging to convert, being prepared to handle common objections can give Farmers Hawaii representatives a competitive edge.

Here are some key points to remember when handling CSG calls:

- Verify the accuracy of the quote, including marital status, number of operators and vehicles, usage, and coverages.
- If the quote is from the same day and no changes are made, provide different payment options and attempt to bind the policy.
- If changes are made to the quote, obtain the necessary information from the customer and update the quote accordingly.
- Build rapport with the customer, set expectations for the call, and uncover their motivation for shopping for insurance.
- Overcome objections and have a clear understanding of why the customer may not be ready to transition to Farmers Hawaii.
- If the customer is interested but not ready to commit, establish a commitment to a firm callback.
- Provide your direct phone number and extension to the customer for any questions they may have before the appointment.

By following these guidelines, Farmers Hawaii representatives can effectively handle CSG calls and increase the chances of converting leads into customers."

When can driver be excluded,"Yes, if the signed Driver Exclusion form is received the same day",kaD4T0000008W05UAE,Pass,nan; nan,Farmers Specialty Auto,foobar,kaD4T0000009B0HUAU,"An excluded driver is a person who is specifically named on an insurance policy as someone who is not covered by the policy. This means that if the excluded driver operates a vehicle, the insurance company will not provide coverage for any bodily injury, loss, or damages that occur while the excluded driver is operating the vehicle.

The definition of an excluded driver can vary by state, so it's important to review your state's Named Driver Exclusion endorsement to see what is specifically excluded. In general, however, excluded drivers are not rated on the policy, which means that they do not affect the cost of the insurance.

There are a number of reasons why a driver may be excluded from a policy, including:

* A history of accidents or traffic violations
* A suspended or revoked driver's license
* A conviction for driving under the influence (DUI)
* A poor credit score
* Being a high-risk driver for any other reason

If you are considering excluding a driver from your policy, it's important to weigh the pros and cons carefully. On the one hand, excluding a high-risk driver can help to lower your insurance costs. On the other hand, it's important to make sure that you are still adequately covered in the event of an accident."

A cancellation fee may be reversed in the following scenarios:

1. **Policy Canceled Due to Non-Payment:** If the policy was canceled due to non-payment and the customer subsequently pays the outstanding balance in full, the cancellation fee may be reversed.

2. **Mid-Term Changes Resulting in Additional Premium:** If the customer made mid-term changes to their policy that resulted in additional premium, and they subsequently cancel the policy, the cancellation fee may be reversed if the customer pays the additional premium.

3. **Cancellation Fee or Short Rate Cancel:** If the customer paid a cancellation fee or short rate cancellation fee, and they subsequently reinstate the policy within a specified timeframe (typically 30 days), the cancellation fee may be reversed.

4. **Cancellation Credits Based on Precise Number of Days of Coverage:** If the policy is canceled mid-term, the cancellation credits are based on the precise number of days of coverage. If there is a slight discrepancy between the amount paid and the amount of coverage received due to a varying number of days in different months, the cancellation fee may be adjusted accordingly.

It's important to note that the specific terms and conditions for reversing cancellation fees may vary depending on the insurance company and the type of policy. If you have questions about whether a cancellation fee can be reversed in your specific situation, it's best to contact your insurance company directly."
