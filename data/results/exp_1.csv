Can I cancel a Foremost policy by Chat?,Any variations of yes," Yes, First and Second named insureds or individuals with control, including additional named insureds, POAs and EOEs are allowed to verbally cancel any product in any state (Except Delaware). 
Louisiana Special Process: The state of Louisiana requires a written request to be documented as part of the policy record. 
Delaware Special Process: For Motorcycle and Motor Home policies being cancelled by insured request, Chat cancellations are not acceptable. The insured must complete the Delaware Cancellation Affidavit (Form 8146) in place of a Chat request, and it must be returned to Foremost.

What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.
Insured Recalls Accident
	If insured recalls the accident, ask the following questions:
o	Details / description of accident.
o	Total repair damages paid to insured?
o	Total repair damages paid to other parties?
o	Did an insureds insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Did the other partys insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Was anyone injured in accident? If so, describe injuries.
	Document policy with specific information:
o	Name of person you spoke with
o	Answers to above questions
	Do NOT refer to Underwriting - information entered in comments will be reviewed when Underwriting diary generates.
	Advise the insured that underwriting will update the policy with the new information, however, it will not necessarily reduce the premium back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault since the accident was previously undisclosed
