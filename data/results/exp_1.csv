How do I fix the issue where the Agent cannot enter a payment through their ACA?,"Resolution
	First, attempt to use the agent's district manager's agent code.
	The district manager's agent code will be the same besides the last two digits, which will be 01.
o	Example: Agent = 45-32-31                 District Manager = 45-32-01
	For Inactive agents, Express should replace the agent code with one of the generic ACA codes below.
	If this has not happened, and the Inactive agents ACA still shows on the billing side of express, please refer for defect 724086. 
	If this does not correct the issue, use one of the ACA codes below and notate the billing account on what code was used for payment:
o	Western Zone  29-99-375
o	Eastern Zone  04-99-375
	Note: Please make sure to document which ACA code you use in your billing comment so the payment can be located if necessary.
