Can I cancel a Foremost policy by Chat?,Any variations of yes," Yes, First and Second named insureds or individuals with control, including additional named insureds, POAs and EOEs are allowed to verbally cancel any product in any state (Except Delaware). 
Louisiana Special Process: The state of Louisiana requires a written request to be documented as part of the policy record. 
Delaware Special Process: For Motorcycle and Motor Home policies being cancelled by insured request, Chat cancellations are not acceptable. The insured must complete the Delaware Cancellation Affidavit (Form 8146) in place of a Chat request, and it must be returned to Foremost. 
Washington Special Process: A specific Chat cancellation script is not required, a clear request to cancel a policy can be received without specific formatting or phrasing. 
Chat Cancellations may be done without additional documentation for Property and Casualty Products within 30 of the cancel request date (number of days applies when backdating only). When counting back the days, do not include the current day in the calculation. 
Once the the 30-day time frame has passed, Advocates can still send the Chat cancellation script and collect a Yes answer, but appropriate supporting documents need to be received.

What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.
Insured Recalls Accident
	If insured recalls the accident, ask the following questions:
o	Details / description of accident.
o	Total repair damages paid to insured?
o	Total repair damages paid to other parties?
o	Did an insureds insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Did the other partys insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Was anyone injured in accident? If so, describe injuries.
	Document policy with specific information:
o	Name of person you spoke with
o	Answers to above questions
	Do NOT refer to Underwriting - information entered in comments will be reviewed when Underwriting diary generates.
	Advise the insured that underwriting will update the policy with the new information, however, it will not necessarily reduce the premium back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault since the accident was previously undisclosed
"," The process for disputing an accident is as follows:

1. Contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident.

	Verify that the customer's last name is the same as their listed spouse. 
	Verify that the customer is listed with their spouse on another policy through Quote Solutions (SAQ) reports.

	If the above information cannot be verified, attempt to get the listed named insured on a 3-way call to receive permission to quote their spouse.  If the named insured can be reached, add the spouse to the policy as a named insured and an operator, per operator eligibility guidelines. 
	NOTE: In the event that the named insured cannot be reached, set a firm follow-up to speak with the named insured.
2.	Number of Operators and Vehicles: For example, three vehicles and one operator. Refer to More Vehicles than Operators.
3.	Usage: Solely to check for business use: For example, occupation is listed as plumber and the quote lists commute, probe for business use.

Customer Service Consultants - if a call disputing CLUE is received, transfer the call to the Claims Department for appropriate handling.
	See How to Locate Phone Numbers for Other Departments for Claims Transfer Procedures
After review, if the Adjuster / Manager agrees with the Insured that the CLUE report is incorrect, a CLUE correction will need to be submitted to Lexis Nexis.

If the Insured discusses the situation with the Adjuster / Manager and does not agree with the decision, the Insured may call Lexis Nexis and file a dispute themselves. If this happens, a CLUE dispute will be received from Lexis Nexis and the claim will need to be investigated to determine if the dispute being presented by the Insured is correct or not. A response (via fax) to Lexis Nexis is needed to advise them if the dispute is valid or not. Discuss the issue with the adjuster who handled their claim.

How to avoid a service charge?,"Two ways to reduce/avoid a service charge:
The customer may pay the amount due before the billing statement is mailed.
The estimated amount due for future installments can be found on a customers billing statement, the Installment Schedule page on a customers Farmers.com account, and the Policy/Installment Detail page in BillingHub.
Please note: Billing statements that are processed for $11.00 or less do not incur a service charge.
The customer may enroll in Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to reduce the service charge, or both EFT and paperless billing to eliminate the service charge.  
Note: EFT means recurring payments made via a direct debit from their checking or savings account using the customers bank routing number and applicable account number.
The customer needs to be fully enrolled in paperless billing, including accepting the Terms and Conditions, before the service charge will be removed.
If a billing statement generates prior to the Terms and Conditions being accepted, a service charge will be applied.
