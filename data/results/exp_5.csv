How do I process a cancellation from an incoming communication?,"INCOMING CORRESPONDENCES
	Process the cancellation request as long as all information listed within the Cancellation procedure has been provided, making sure the name on the request matches the named insured on the policy. 
	Effective date of cancellation (Written Correspondence) - Use requested future date (limited to 30 days in the future from postmark date if in current term / no limit for renewals that have generated but not yet taken effect), if indicated on the letter, or date after postmark (for letters).  Use day after fax or email.  For verbal requests, see the following:
o	What changes require a signed request from the named insured?  
o	How to handle an insured's request to cancel their personal auto policy
	If the insured has written the request to cancel on a 21st Century renewal bill or a 21st Century renewal declaration page (and no specific date is requested), cancel the effective date of the renewal term. 
	When in doubt, make an outbound call to confirm the date with the insured.
	Comment on every cancellation how the request was received and how the effective date was determined. 
	For written requests, send the letter, fax or a printed copy of the email to Image for potential future reference.  NOTE: Send envelopes with work for quality only if the postmark was used to determine effective date.
o	If the Policyholder is requesting to backdate the cancellation request, we will need a Declaration Page, Proof of Insurance letter (must be on company letterhead and contain information similar to Dec), ID Card(s), or Binder in order to complete the request. 
o	Documentation must show the Named Insured(s) and vehicle(s) listed on our policy as being insured on the date that corresponds to the cancellation effective date being requested.

	Example Comment: ""Received customers request to back date cancellation effective xx/xx/xxxx, all information requested was provided, imaged request.""
	Check the policy comments to see if there is another issued for this customer in the same state or another state.  If a multi-car discount has been applied to the policy that is remaining in force, (this would only apply if it is a single vehicle policy) this discount must now be deleted.

What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.
Insured Recalls Accident
	If insured recalls the accident, ask the following questions:
o	Details / description of accident.
o	Total repair damages paid to insured?
o	Total repair damages paid to other parties?
o	Did an insureds insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Did the other partys insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Was anyone injured in accident? If so, describe injuries.
	Document policy with specific information:
o	Name of person you spoke with
o	Answers to above questions
	Do NOT refer to Underwriting - information entered in comments will be reviewed when Underwriting diary generates.
	Advise the insured that underwriting will update the policy with the new information, however, it will not necessarily reduce the premium back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault since the accident was previously undisclosed

Probe if the insured may be buying and selling vehicles or if an unusual circumstance exists that are not addressed in the underwriting guidelines, do not add vehicle

   - Vehicles that are not properly titled or registered may be considered higher risk.

5. **Garaging Location**:

1. **Frequency of Vehicle Changes**:
   - Review transaction history for frequent buying/selling or side businesses (e.g., taxi service).
   - Ensure no commercial exposures and named insured has insurable interest in all vehicles.

2. **Vehicle Usage**:
   - Understand how vehicles are used (personal, commuting, business).
   - Assess risk and determine appropriate coverage.

3. **Vehicle Titling and Registration**:
   - Verify vehicles are titled and registered in the named insured's name or eligible family member.
   - Ensure legal ownership and responsibility.

4. **Number of Drivers in Household**:
   - Determine the number of drivers and who operates the vehicles.
   - Assess overall risk associated with the policy.

5. **Garaging Address**:
   - Confirm vehicles are principally garaged at the resident address.
   - Consider exceptions for vehicles stored elsewhere due to space constraints or other reasons.

Why Is the registered owner of my vehicle not someone in my household?,"ID cards reflect that the registered owner for a vehicle is someone who is not listed in the household. At times this may be done because the Registered Owner is someone other then the vehicle owner.

If vehicle is leased it should show the owner as the leasing company or if the registered owner is listed as a RO type of additional insured they will show as the Registered owner on ID cards.

The person listed on the ID cards could have been pulled in from SIMS.

If necessary please contact Personal Lines for further assistance to determine if registered owner is showing correctly. ","**Reasons why the registered owner of your vehicle may not be someone in your household:**

- **Leased vehicle:** If the vehicle is leased, the leasing company will be listed as the registered owner.
- **Additional insured:** The registered owner may be listed as an additional insured on the policy with a type of RO (Registered Owner).
- **SIMS (State Insurance Management System):** The person listed on the ID cards could have been pulled from SIMS.

**Steps to resolve the issue:**

1. Access the policy in Express and go to the vehicle tab.
2. Modify the vehicle with the incorrect registered owner.
3. Select the registered owner drop-down and deselect the person currently listed, even if it is showing the correct registered owner.
4. Select the correct registered owner and click 'update'.

**Registered Owner Information on ID Cards**

If the registered owner on your vehicle ID cards isn't someone in your household, here are a few reasons why:

- **Leasing Company:** If your vehicle is leased, the leasing company might be listed as the registered owner.

- **Additional Insured:** If someone other than the vehicle owner is listed as an additional insured, they may appear as the registered owner.

- **Incorrect Information:** In some cases, the registered owner information on your ID cards may be pulled from SIMS and may not be accurate.

**To update the registered owner information:**

1. Log in to Express and access your policy.

Customer Service Consultants - if a call disputing CLUE is received, transfer the call to the Claims Department for appropriate handling.
