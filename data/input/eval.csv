What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.
Insured Recalls Accident
	If insured recalls the accident, ask the following questions:
o	Details / description of accident.
o	Total repair damages paid to insured?
o	Total repair damages paid to other parties?
o	Did an insureds insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Did the other partys insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Was anyone injured in accident? If so, describe injuries.
	Document policy with specific information:
o	Name of person you spoke with
o	Answers to above questions
	Do NOT refer to Underwriting - information entered in comments will be reviewed when Underwriting diary generates.
	Advise the insured that underwriting will update the policy with the new information, however, it will not necessarily reduce the premium back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault since the accident was previously undisclosed

Insured wants to dispute a loss with Farmers Hawaii,"Disputed Activity  Loss With Farmers Hawaii

When an Insured attempts to obtain insurance with another company it is likely that that company will order a CLUE report through Lexis Nexis that will show claim activity reported by Farmers Hawaii.

If the insured disagrees with what is being reported by Farmers Hawaii, they may contact Farmers Hawaii to correct reported activity.
Customer Service Consultants - if a call disputing CLUE is received, transfer the call to the Claims Department for appropriate handling.
	See How to Locate Phone Numbers for Other Departments for Claims Transfer Procedures
After review, if the Adjuster / Manager agrees with the Insured that the CLUE report is incorrect, a CLUE correction will need to be submitted to Lexis Nexis.

If the Insured discusses the situation with the Adjuster / Manager and does not agree with the decision, the Insured may call Lexis Nexis and file a dispute themselves. If this happens, a CLUE dispute will be received from Lexis Nexis and the claim will need to be investigated to determine if the dispute being presented by the Insured is correct or not. A response (via fax) to Lexis Nexis is needed to advise them if the dispute is valid or not. Discuss the issue with the adjuster who handled their claim.
