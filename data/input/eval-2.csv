How do I process a cancellation from an incoming communication?,"INCOMING CORRESPONDENCES
	Process the cancellation request as long as all information listed within the Cancellation procedure has been provided, making sure the name on the request matches the named insured on the policy. 
	Effective date of cancellation (Written Correspondence) - Use requested future date (limited to 30 days in the future from postmark date if in current term / no limit for renewals that have generated but not yet taken effect), if indicated on the letter, or date after postmark (for letters).  Use day after fax or email.  For verbal requests, see the following:
o	What changes require a signed request from the named insured?  
o	How to handle an insured's request to cancel their personal auto policy
	If the insured has written the request to cancel on a 21st Century renewal bill or a 21st Century renewal declaration page (and no specific date is requested), cancel the effective date of the renewal term. 
	When in doubt, make an outbound call to confirm the date with the insured.
	Comment on every cancellation how the request was received and how the effective date was determined. 
	For written requests, send the letter, fax or a printed copy of the email to Image for potential future reference.  NOTE: Send envelopes with work for quality only if the postmark was used to determine effective date.
o	If the Policyholder is requesting to backdate the cancellation request, we will need a Declaration Page, Proof of Insurance letter (must be on company letterhead and contain information similar to Dec), ID Card(s), or Binder in order to complete the request. 
o	Documentation must show the Named Insured(s) and vehicle(s) listed on our policy as being insured on the date that corresponds to the cancellation effective date being requested. 
o	If the request is missing info (Dec Page, POI letter, ID Card, or Binder), place an outbound call to obtain. 
	If contact is made, add a diary comment with missing information and process.  The only exception to this is a missing signature.  In this case, a revised request is required. 
	If no contact is made, add a diary comment what is needed and the effective date of cancellation. 
	Example Comment: ""Received customers request to back date cancellation effective xx/xx/xxxx, all information requested was provided, imaged request.""
	Check the policy comments to see if there is another issued for this customer in the same state or another state.  If a multi-car discount has been applied to the policy that is remaining in force, (this would only apply if it is a single vehicle policy) this discount must now be deleted. 
o	The customer should receive a call to advise them of the premium change due to the deletion of the multi-car discount. 
","**To process a cancellation from an incoming communication:**

1. Ensure all information in the cancellation procedure is provided.
2. Verify the name on the cancellation request matches the named insured on the policy.
3. Determine the effective date of cancellation:
    - If a future date is specified (up to 30 days from the postmark date for current terms or no limit for generated but not yet effective renewals), use that date.
    - If no specific date is requested, use the date after the postmark for letters, the day after the fax or email is received, or the date specified on a 21st Century renewal bill or declaration page.
    - If the insured requests to backdate the cancellation, obtain proof of insurance showing the insured and vehicle(s) listed on our policy as being insured on the requested cancellation effective date.
4. If any information is missing, contact the insured to obtain it.
5. Add a diary comment with the missing information and process the cancellation if contact is made.

What is the process for disputing an accident?,"Disputed Activity  Accidents
	Accident involvement (code 166) appears on a Motor Vehicle Report when an insured has been involved in an accident and an accident report was completed and filed with the Department of Motor Vehicles. The MVR unit or underwriting department pursues the details so the accident can be added and policy correctly rated. An outbound call is first attempted, then, if no response, it is followed by a letter asking the insured for accident details. UWACCDETMVR or MVACCDETMVR
	If no response is received, the accident is assumed to be at-fault. Accident entry code 599 with default amount of $2501 (or 516 if indicated with injury) is entered, often in conjunction with a re-class. 
Insured Does Not Recall Accident
	Read Underwriting comments to determine driver involved and date of accident. A copy of the automated letter is in image.
	Contact Underwriting for them to do a test quote to see if change in accident details will have any effect on premium.  If not, advise insured of no effect - no need to proceed. 
	Instruct the insured to contact the Department of Motor Vehicle to obtain the accident report that was completed for the listed accident to jog their memory. We will not change the description of the accident until we have details of the accident.
	Advise the insured that once the information is retrieved, they may fax documentation to dispute the loss to the Underwriting Department at 1-800-895-2294. The premium will not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, since the accident was previously undisclosed.
Insured Recalls Accident
	If insured recalls the accident, ask the following questions:
o	Details / description of accident.
o	Total repair damages paid to insured?
o	Total repair damages paid to other parties?
o	Did an insureds insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Did the other partys insurance carrier pay for damages? If so, how much?
o	Was anyone injured in accident? If so, describe injuries.
	Document policy with specific information:
o	Name of person you spoke with
o	Answers to above questions
	Do NOT refer to Underwriting - information entered in comments will be reviewed when Underwriting diary generates.
	Advise the insured that underwriting will update the policy with the new information, however, it will not necessarily reduce the premium back to the quoted amount even if the accident is determined to be not at fault since the accident was previously undisclosed
","**How to Dispute an Accident**

1. Check the underwriting comments to determine the driver involved and the date of the accident.


2. Contact Underwriting to perform a test quote to see if changes in accident details affect the premium.


3. If there's no effect, inform the insured and stop the process.


4. Instruct the insured to get the accident report from the Department of Motor Vehicle to help them remember.


5. Gather the following information and email it to USW_SO_BWIG_UnderwritingSupportGroup:
    - Claim number
    - Policyholder's name
    - Date of loss


6. The Underwriting team will forward the request to Claims.


7. The Claims adjuster will contact the customer within 48 hours to review the dispute.


8. Claims will send a response to the Underwriting team, who will update the auto policy and submit a CLUE correction form to Lexis Nexis to fix the fault status.


**Note:** Even if the accident is determined to be not at fault, the premium might not necessarily be reduced back to the quoted amount since the accident was previously undisclosed.",kaD4T000000PGE4UAO,"kaD4T000000PGE4UAO
